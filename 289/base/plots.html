<li>Shows how many people have been confirmed to be infected (blue) or
have died (red) as a function of time.</li>
<li>The y-axis is logarithmic, that means from one grid line to the next,
the value represented increases by a factor of 10. (Axis labels: 102=

blue bars.</li>
<li>Blue lines show a seven day (rolling) average over the bar data
(using a Gaussian window with a standard deviation of 3 days) - this
produces smoother data. It also helps to remove the effect of the
weekend (in some countries reported numbers drop during and just
after the weekend)</li>
<li>We would like to see these numbers of daily changes decrease from day
to day. The faster they go down the better. Ideally their reach 0.</li>
<li>For the data of South Korea, we can see that the peak of new
infections was around 1st March 2020, and following that the number
of new infections decreased to around 100 per day for the second half
of March, before the numbers started to decrease further.</li>

<h3>Reproduction number R</h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_reproduction_number">Reproduction number R (Wikipedia)</a> expresses how
many people are infected from one person with COVID19.</li>
<li>If we assume an average infectious period, we can estimate R from the reported
new cases. This estimate of R is shown as the green line. The estimate of R
will be affected by inaccuracies in the reported numbers.</li>
<li>Following the Robert Koch Institute, we assume an average infectious period of
4 days. This means, for example, for a reproduction number R=2, that on
average each infected person will infect 2 other people after 4 days.</li>
<li>R needs to be below 1.0 for the total number of infections to
shrink. A value of R above 1 will lead to exponential growth.</li>
<li>See <a class="reference external" href="r-value.html">this page</a> for more details.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="daily-growth-factor">
<h3>Daily growth factor</h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The growth factor is the ratio of new cases today
relative to new cases yesterday</li>
<li>Blue dots show these ratios for cases, and are
computed based on the smoothed data shown in plot 2 and 3.</li>
<li>The solid line is a 7-day rolling mean over these points to provide
smoother data.</li>
<li>As long as the growth value is greater than 1.0, the number of new
infections is increasing.</li>
<li>If the growth value is exactly 1.0, then we have the same number of
new infections every day.</li>
<li>The growth factor needs to be below 1.0 for the spread to slow down.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="assessing-success-for-containment-measures">
<h3>Assessing success for containment measures</h3>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><strong>The reproduction number R and the growth factors are measures of success for
the virus containment</strong>: as long as they are below 1.0, the spread
is slowing down. If the growth factor is greater than one, the number of newly
infected people is increasing from day to day; this must be avoided.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">What is the difference between R and the growth factor? They are computed
differently. The growth factor is simpler and more direct: it describes
changes in new infections from day to day.</p>
<p>The reproduction number R is used in epidemiology, and by politicians. It is
<a class="reference external" href="r-value.html">harder to estimate</a> than the daily growth factor.
The daily growth factor and
R cannot be compared directly, but both are qualitatively similar: they need
to stay under 1.0 for the infections to become fewer over time.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Growth factor and R do not depend on the total number of new cases (but only
on the relative change over time). For that reason we can get high
fluctuations where the numbers of new cases is small (imagine there
was 1 case yesterday, and 7 cases today, this would give a growth factor of
7). In short: where the number of daily new cases is small, the growth
factor can appear to change quickly. For the same reason, R and the growth
factor are good indicators to assess changes in spread even with small case
numbers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="plot-5-r-growth-factor-based-on-deaths">
<h2>Plot 5: R &amp; growth factor based on deaths</h2>
<img src="./fig-south-korea5.svg" alt="South Korea data"><p>Conventionally, the R number is computed on infections (here shown in plot 4 and
referred to as &quot;R based on cases&quot;). Assuming a fixed mortality rate, we can also
use the reported deaths to estimate R (as R depends not on the total numbers but
their change over time). This is done in plot 5, and the estimated R is shown in
yellow. See discussion of plot 4 above for details.</p>
<p>This computation of R based on deaths can be of interest, for example, for the
case of the <a class="reference external" href="html/United-Kingdom.html">United Kingdom</a>, where the daily new
infections remained approximately constant from about 10 April to about 10 May,
but at the same time the daily number of deaths shows a slow but persistent
reduction from day to day. A possible explanation for the situation would be
that the nearly constant number of daily infections results from a saturation of
the testing capacity, and that actually the spread is reducing (which is
reflected in the deaths, which may be more accurately captured and reported). In
that case, the R based on deaths may provide a more accurate estimate.</p>
<p>If deaths and infections are similarly captured and reported, both entities
should point to the same value, although the R based on deaths could be trailing
the estimate of R based on infections by several weeks; reflecting the duration
of the illness.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="plot-6-doubling-times">
<h2>Plot 6: Doubling times</h2>
<img src="./fig-south-korea6.svg" alt="South Korea data"><ul>
<li><p class="first">This plot computes the doubling time of the cases (blue) and deaths
(red), assuming that the growth of cases and deaths as shown in plot
1 is exponential.</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">In more detail, we compute the doubling period from one day to the
next and show this as transparent dots.</p>
<p>If a value of 3 is shown, this means that at that point in time,
it took 3 days for the numbers of cases (or deaths) to double.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The solid line is a 7-day rolling mean over these data points and
provides more robust guidance.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Looking at the doubling time shown by the solid lines, we get another
indicator to assess the spread of the virus.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>For many countries, in the early stages of the outbreak, this
doubling time for confirmed infections (blue line) is somewhere
around 2 to 3 days.</li>
<li>As the spread of infections is reduced (by schools closing, people
exercising social distancing, staying at home, etc), the growth
rate of the exponential function becomes smaller, and
correspondingly the doubling time increases.</li>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt>We would like to see the doubling time to get larger, as this an indication</dt>
<dd>that the growth of infections and deaths is decreasing (ideally infinitely
large, when no new infections occur).</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The example data for South Korea shows that</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>the doubling time for cases grows from around 3 days in the early stages</li>
<li>to reach a plateau with a doubling time of around 60 days from 15 March to 1
April 2020. During this time, the number of daily new infections (plot 2)
stabilises around 100, and the growth factor (blue line in plot 4) is approximately 1.0.</li>
<li>In April, the doubling time increases further, which corresonds to a
further reduction of daily new infections (plot 2), and a growth factor
(blue line in plot 4) below 1.0.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Occasionally, the solid lines are omitted if there are not enough data points.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="plot-7-comparison-of-daily-new-cases-with-other-countries">
<h2>Plot 7: Comparison of daily new cases with other countries</h2>
<img src="./fig-south-korea7.svg" alt="South Korea data"><ul class="simple">
<li>The x-axis shows the number of days since a particular number of new
cases per day (such as 10) have occurred in that country, and the
y-axis the number of new cases for that day.</li>
<li>We see that countries follow similar paths, with the common
properties that the curve increases until the number of cases per day
peaks, and then the curve comes down again.</li>
<li>The y-axis is logarithmic.</li>
<li>Due to the logarithmic y-axis, this visualisation can help to
understand at what stage in the outbreak an area is (despite the
different size of the countries and numbers of cases).</li>
<li>The curve shows as 7-day rolling mean to provide a smoother line than
the noisier individual data points (in particular with fewer cases
per day). This leads to non-integer values.</li>
<li>[The curve for China starts at a higher value than 10, as the first recorded
value was 548. We could manually correct this.]</li>
